check memory and cpu  -> req and limit

-This gives: InitialRAMPercentage
  •	Initial heap ≈ 15% of 8 GB ≈ 1.2 GB
	•	Max heap ≈ 50% of 8 GB ≈ 4 GB
	•	JVM grows heap only if needed
	•	No dangerous startup spike

What is -XX:+UseContainerSupport?

In simple words:

It tells the JVM to respect the container’s CPU and memory limits instead of the host machine’s full resources.

Without this flag, the JVM may think it has access to:
	•	The entire node’s memory (e.g., 64 GB)
	•	The entire node’s CPU cores (e.g., 32 cores)

Even though your pod is limited to a much smaller slice (like 1.5 GB or 8 GB).
